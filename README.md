# Beacons Take-Home Assessment
## Running the Application
To view the React app, please run:
1) cd into the git repository
2) Run: `npm install`
3) Run: `npm start` 

The web app should appear in a browser tab on localhost:3000.

## Future Features
If I were to iterate on this project, I would add:
1) Redux for cleaner state management
2) A color wheel for user-selected colors
3) Lazing loading links that appear below the fold
